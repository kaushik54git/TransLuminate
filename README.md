# TransLuminate

TransLuminate is a Python application built using the Tkinter GUI toolkit. It features a customizable, translucent, click-through window overlay that helps in reducing eye strain by allowing users to dim their screens and apply colored filters. This tool is particularly useful for managing varying background brightness across different applications.

## Features

- **Full-screen Overlay**: Covers the entire screen with a translucent filter.
- **Adjustable Transparency**: A slider control allows users to adjust the transparency level of the overlay.
- **Color Customization**: Users can choose any color for the overlay to enhance visual comfort.
- **Click-Through Capability**: Allows interaction with applications underneath the overlay, without having to disable or close the overlay.
- **Simple User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with a control panel for quick adjustments.

## Installation

To get started with TransLuminate, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended.
2. Clone this repository:
   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaushik54git/TransLuminate.git
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
